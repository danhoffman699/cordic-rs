# CORDIC: Coaching Old, Really Dull Integrated Circuits

Illinois CS SAIL 2021

## NOTE
The course is currently under development. The code itself works, but I'll expand it before the course to include
  - Choice between Fixed Point vs IEEE 754
  - Unit tests to demonstrate IEEE 754 error buildup (in contrast to fixed point)
  - In-line derivations in the comments (most of these will be presented live)
